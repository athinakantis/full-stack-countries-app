## What this project has taught me

### **Redux**

This project has given me the opportunity to learn about state management using **Redux**.  
The idea behind state management in react remains the same among most state management libraries:

1. Creating the context
2. Connecting the context
3. Providing the context
4. Listening for change

### **Tailwind CSS**

Something I've been curious about for a while and I finally got to try it.  
Basically you're able to add styling via classes and the class names are very self-explanatory.

**Pros:**

- I don't have to dig through a long CSS file or multiple CSS files to edit the styling
- Syntax is easy with a very nice [Cheat Sheet](https://nerdcave.com/tailwind-cheat-sheet) to look through

**Cons:**

- Components can become cluttered
